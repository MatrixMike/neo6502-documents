# Using CC65

There is an excellent sample CC65 project which is a 'getting started' example with build files, source code and a sample library.

[https://github.com/PeteGollan/Neo6502-programs/tree/main/HelloNeo6502-CC65](https://github.com/PeteGollan/Neo6502-programs/tree/main/HelloNeo6502-CC65)

There are some less well developed examples in the examples in the release.

# Using CC65

There are two references on using CC65

Pete Gollan wrote the following, which has a sample project that can be used as a starter

Andy McCall wrote a walkthrough and example code on using a combination of LLVM-MOS and CC65 here, which is Linux / Mac centric but the basic ideas could be adapted for Windows.

There are some C examples in the release, but they are considerably more primitive.

# Keyboard Locales

Locales are available for the following

* US (default)
* DE (Germany)
* FI (Finland)
* GB (Great Britain)
* IT (Italy)

To create a locale , base it on the files at [https://github.com/paulscottrobson/neo6502-firmware/tree/main/firmware/common/locale](https://github.com/paulscottrobson/neo6502-firmware/tree/main/firmware/common/locale)

Either create it as a pull request or send it to me personally.

The locale is set using the boot program autostart.bas or the locale "(name)" command

**Note** at present we only support ASCII characters 32-127

# Where Next
So you now have a working Neo6502. Here are some places to explore.

## Wiki

There is a wiki which various other features at https://github.com/paulscottrobson/neo6502-firmware/wiki ; this is pretty basic but is currently under review for expansion.
## Discord
There is an active discord where you can ask questions or whatever of the people involved in software and hardware, and ask for assistance. 

There is a link to join it here https://www.facebook.com/groups/745798620676673/permalink/852689913320876

## Languages available

C and Pascal development are currently working well (both LLVM and CC65) as well as Assembler and BASIC. Forth and a variant are currently under development. There is an early version of LLVM documentation and a more complete Pascal example on the wiki page.

## Other software

Other software is available, linked from the Wiki, now including a Tile map and Sprite editor, and a file manager, and some games.

## Facebook
There is a facebook group here https://www.facebook.com/groups/745798620676673
## BASIC & API Documents (at present)
The release contains two documents basic.pdf and api.pdf which detail the BASIC interpreter and the API operation respectively. They are rather dry but complete.
## Assembler, BASIC , C and Pascal examples
Under examples are a variety of sample programs some of which are full programs, some demonstrate specific features of BASIC or the API. The .bsc files are text versions of the BASIC files.
## The Youtube series
There is a 7 part youtube video series of about 30 minutes in total here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbcAHRVTqpE which walks through programming a simple game in BASIC using cross development and external tools. Much of it is applicable to C and Pascal which uses the same API - many BASIC commands are simple wrappers round the API functions.

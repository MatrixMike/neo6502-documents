# Where Next
So you now have a working Neo6502. Here are some places to explore.

## Discord
There is an active discord where you can ask questions or whatever of the people involved in software and hardware, and ask for assistance. 

There is a link to join it  [here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/745798620676673/permalink/852689913320876)

## Languages available

C and Pascal development are currently working well (both LLVM and CC65) as well as Assembler and BASIC. Forth and a variant are currently under development. There is an early version of LLVM documentation and a more complete Pascal example on the wiki page.

## Other software

Other software is available, linked from the Wiki, now including a Tile map and Sprite editor, and a file manager, and some games.

## Facebook
There is a facebook group  [here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/745798620676673)
## Assembler, BASIC , C and Pascal examples
Under "examples" are a variety of sample programs some of which are full programs, some demonstrate specific features of BASIC or the API. The .bsc files are text versions of the BASIC files.
## The Youtube series
There is a [7 part youtube video series of about 30 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbcAHRVTqpE&list=PLP0Pow806SUMAOoiHSks_xqrspu9pPwnN) which walks through programming a simple game in BASIC using cross development and external tools. Much of it is applicable to C and Pascal which uses the same API - many BASIC commands are simple wrappers round the API functions.

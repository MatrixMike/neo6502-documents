# Neo6502 Messaging API

The Neo6502 API is a messaging system. There are no methods to access the hardware directly. Messages are passed via the block of memory from $FF00 to $FF0F, as specified in the "API Messaging Addresses" table on the following page.

The kernel include file documents/release/neo6502.inc specifies the beginning of this address range as the identifier ControlPort, along with the addresses of WaitMessage and SendMessage (described later), various related kernel jump vectors, and some helper functions.

The application include files examples/assembly/neo6502.asm.inc and examples/C/neo6502.h also specify the beginning of this address range as the identifier ControlPort. The assembly include also specifies ControlPort and the other controls as API_COMMAND, API_FUNCTION, API_ERROR, API_STATUS, and API_PARAMETERS. The C header also specifies ControlPort and the other controls as API_COMMAND_ADDR, API_FUNCTION_ADDR, API_ERROR_ADDR, API_STATUS_ADDR, and API_PARAMETERS_ADDR.

API Commands/Functions are grouped by functionality. For example, Group 1 are system-related, and Group 2 are console-I/O-related. 

Command/Function Parameters are notated in this document as Params[0] through Params[7], or as a list or range (eg: Params[1,2], Params[0..7]). Note that these are referring to a mapping to memory locations. The numbers represent offsets from the Parameters base address $FF04. Ie: the actual bytes are not necessarily all distinct "parameters" in the conventional sense. Depending on the routine, a logical parameter may be an individual byte, one or more bits of a byte interpreted as a composite or bit-field, or multiple adjacent bytes interpreted as 16 or 32 bit values. For example, the list Params[0,1] would indicate a single logical parameter, comprised of the two adjacent bytes $FF04 and $FF05. The range Params[4..7] would indicate a single logical parameter, spanning consecutive bytes between $FF08 and $FF0B.

**Note that strings referenced by Parameters are not ASCIIZ, but are length-prefixed.** 

The first byte represents the length of the string (not counting itself). The string begins at the second byte. Consequently, strings must be 256 bytes or less (not counting the length header).

### API Messaging Addresses

| Address | Type       | Notes                                                        |
| ------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| FF00    | Group      | Group selector and status. Writing a non-zero value to this location triggers the routine specified in $FF01. The system will respond by setting the 'Error', 'Information', and 'Parameters' values appropriately. Upon completion, this memory location will be will cleared. |
| FF01    | Function   | A command or function within the selected Group. For example, Group 1 Function 0 writes a value to the console; and Group 1 Function 1 reads the keyboard. |
| FF02    | Error      | Return any error values, 0 = no error.                       |
| FF03:7  | Status     | Set (1) if the ESCape key has been pressed. This is not automatically reset. |
| FF03:6  | *unused*   |                                                              |
| FF03:5  | *unused*   |                                                              |
| FF03:4  | *unused*   |                                                              |
| FF03:3  | *unused*   |                                                              |
| FF03:2  | *unused*   |                                                              |
| FF03:1  | *unused*   |                                                              |
| FF03:0  | *unused*   |                                                              |
| FF04..  | Parameters | This memory block is notated in this document as Params[0] through Params[7], or as a composite list or range (eg: Params[1,2], Params[0..7]). Some Functions require Parameters in these locations and some return values in these locations; yet others do neither. |

## API Interfacing Protocol

Neo6502 application programmers should interact with the API per the
following algorithm:

1.  Wait for any pending command to complete. There is a subroutine WaitMessage which does this for the developer.

2.  Setup the Function code at $FF01; and any Parameters across $FF04..$FF0B. To print a character for example, set $FF01 to $06 and set $FF04 to the character's ASCII value. To draw a line, set $FF01 to $02 and set $FF04..$FF0B as four 16-bit pixel coordinates:

3.  Setup the command code at $FF00. This triggers the routine; so mind that the Function code and Parameters are setup sanely prior. On a technical point, both implementations process the message immediately on write.

4.  Optionally, wait for completion. Most commands (eg: writing to the console) do not require waiting, as any subsequent command will wait/queue as per step 1. Query commands (e.g. reading from the keyboard queue), return a value in a parameter. Programs must wait until the control address $FF00 has been cleared before reading the result of a query.

There is a support function SendMessage, which in-lines the command and function. E.g.: this code from the Kernel:

`jsr KSendMessage ; send message for command 2,1 (read keyboard)`

`.byte 2,1`

`jsr KWaitMessage ; wait to receive the result message`

`lda DParameters ; read result`

The instructions above are equivalent to the following explicit steps:

`lda #1`

`sta DFunction`

`lda #2`

`sta DCommand ; trigger API function 2,1 (read keyboard)`

`Loop:`

`lda DCommand ; load the result - non-zero until the routine's completion`

`bne Loop ; wait for API routine to complete`

`lda DParameters ; read result (a key-code)`

## Mathematical Interface

The mathematical interface of the API functions largely as a helper system for the BASIC interpreted, but it is open to any developer who wishes to avail themselves of the functionality. It is strongly advised that function 32 of Group 4 (NumberToDecimal) is not used as this is extremely specific and as such is not documented.

The interface is used in a stack environment, but is designed so it could be used in either a stack environment or a fixed location environment. The Neo6502 BASIC stack is also 'split', so elements are not consecutive, though they can be.

Parameter 0 and 1 specify the address of the registers 1 and 2. Register 1 starts at this address, Register 2 starts at the next address. Parameter 2 specifies the step to the next register. Therefore they are interleaved by default at present.

So if Parameters 0 and 1 are 8100 and Parameter 2 is 4, the 5 byte registers are

- Register 1: 8100,8104,8108,810C,8110

- Register 2: 8101,8105,8109,810D,8111


Bytes 1-4 of the 'register' are the number, which can be either an integer (32 bit signed) or a standard 'C' float (e.g. the IEEE Single Precision Float format). Bit 0 is the type byte, and the relevant bit is bit 6, which is set to indicate bytes 1-4 are a float value, and is set on return.

Binary functions that use int and float combined (one is int and one is float) normally return a float.

# Console Codes

The following are console key codes. They can be printed in BASIC programs using chr$(n), and are also related to the character keys returned by inkey$(). The key() function uses physical key numbers. Some control codes do not have corresponding keyboard keys; and some console outputs are not yet implemented.

Backspace (8), Tab (9), Enter/CR (13), Escape (27), and the printable characters (32..127) are the standard ASCII set. Other typical control keys (eg: Home and arrows) are mapped into the 0..31 range.

# Graphics

## Graphics Settings

Function 5,1 configures the global graphics system settings. Not all Parameters are relevant for all graphics commands; but all Parameters will be set by this command. So mind their values.

The actual color of each drawn pixel will be computed at runtime by AND'ing the existing pixel color with the value specified in Params[0], then XOR'ing the result with the value specified in Params[1].

The value in Params[2] is a flag which determines the paint fill mode for the Draw Rectangle and Draw Ellipse commands: reset (0) for outline, set (1) for solid fill.

The value in Params[3] is the draw extent (window) for the Draw Image command.

The value in Params[4] is a bit-field of flags for the Draw Image command, which determine if the image will be inverted (flipped) horizontally or vertically: bit-0 for horizontal, bit-1 for vertical, reset (0) for normal, set (1) for inverted.

For the "Draw Rectangle" and "Draw Ellipse" commands, the given order and position of the coordinates are not significant. To be precise, one is "a corner" and the other is "the opposite corner". For the "Draw Ellipse" command, these corners are referring to the bounding-box. The coordinates for an ellipse will lie outside of the ellipse itself.

## Graphics Data

Graphics data files are conventionally named ending in the .gfx suffix; though this is not mandatory. The format is quite simple.

#### Graphics Data Format

| Offset | Data  | Notes                          |
| ------ | ----- | ------------------------------ |
| 0      | 1     | Graphics Data Format ID        |
| 1      | Count | Number of 16x16 tiles in use   |
| 2      | Count | Number of 16x16 sprites in use |
| 3      | Count | Number of 32x32 sprites in use |
| 4..255 |       | Reserved                       |
| 256    | Raw   | Sprites graphics data          |

The layout of sprites graphics data is all of the 16x16 tiles, followed by all the 16x16 sprites, followed by all the 32x32 sprites, all in their respective orders. As there is currently only about 20kB of Graphics Memory, these should be used somewhat sparingly.

Each byte specifies 2 pixels. The upper 4 bits represent the first pixel colour; and the lower 4 bits represent the second pixel colour. So tiles and 16x16 sprites occupy 16x16/2 bytes (128 bytes) each. Each 32x32 sprite occupies 32x32/2 bytes (512 bytes). Colour 0 is transparent for sprites (colour 9 should be used for a black pixel).

The release package includes Python scripts for creating graphics files, which allow you to design graphics using your preferred editing tools (eg: Gimp, Inkscape, Krita, etc). There is an example in the crossdev directory, which demonstrates how to get started importing graphics into the Neo6502.

## Pixel Colours

| Pixel | Colour            |
| ----- | ----------------- |
| 0     | Black/Transparent |
| 1     | Red               |
| 2     | Green             |
| 3     | Yellow            |
| 4     | Blue              |
| 5     | Magenta           |
| 6     | Cyan              |
| 7     | White             |
| 8     | Black             |
| 9     | Dark Grey         |
| 10    | Dark Green        |
| 11    | Orange            |
| 12    | Dark Orange       |
| 13    | Brown             |
| 14    | Pink              |
| 15    | Light Grey        |

# Tile Maps

A tile map occupies an area of user memory in 65C02. It is comprised of three meta-data bytes, followed by one byte for each tile, which is it's tile number in the graphic file (refer to the following section).

F0-FF are special reserved tile numbers, F0 is a transparent tile; and F1-FF are a solid tile in the current palette colour. The format is very simple.

**Tile Maps Format**

| Offset | Data   | Notes                                      |
| ------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| 0      | 1      | Graphics Data Format ID                    |
| 1      | Width  | Width of tile-map (number of tiles)        |
| 2      | Height | Height of tile-map (number of tiles)       |
| 3..    | Raw    | Tiles graphics data (width * height bytes) |

# Sprites

The Neo6502 graphics system has one sprite layer (z-plane) in the conventional sense. Technically, there is no "sprite layer", per-se. The system uses palette manipulation to create, what is in practice, a pair of 4-bit bit-planes. The sprite graphics are in the upper nibble, the background is in the lower nibble, and the background is drawn only if the sprite graphic layer is zero. It's this top nibble which is read by Function 5,36 "Read Sprite Pixel".

Function 6,2 sets or updates a sprite. These parameters (eg: the X and Y coordinates) cannot be set independently. To retain/reuse the current value of a parameter for a subsequent call, set each of the associated byte(s) to $80 (eg: $80,$80,$80,$80 for coordinates).

The 'Sprite' Parameter Params[0] specifies the index of the sprite in the graphics system. Sprite 0 is the turtle sprite.

Params[1,2],Params[3,4] specifies the X and Y screen coordinates.

Bits 0-5 of the 'Image' Parameter Params[5] specify the index of a specific graphic within the sprites data. Bit 6 of the 'Image' Parameter specifies the sprite dimensions: reset (0) for 16x16, set (1) for 32x32. In practice, the index is the same as the sprite number ($80-$BF for 16x16 sprites, $C0-$FF for 32x32 sprites), but without bit-7 set.

The value in Params[6] specifies a bit-field of flags, which determines if the graphic will be inverted (flipped) horizontally or vertically: bit-0 for horizontal, bit-1 for vertical, reset (0) for normal, set (1) for inverted.

Params[7] specifies the anchor alignment. 

## Sprite Anchors

The table below shows the valid anchor alignments for a sprite. The anchor position is the origin of the relative coordinate given. That is, coordinates 0,0 of the sprite will coincide with one of the positions shown in the table below. The default anchor alignment is zero (middle-center).



|      |      |      |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
|  7   |  8   |  9   |
|      |      |      |
|  4   | 0/5  |  6   |
|      |      |      |
|  1   |  2   |  3   |

To the right are two examples. Assume this is a 32x32 sprite. In the upper example, the anchor point is at 8, the top-center. Considering the origin at the bottom-left, this sprite is drawn at 16,32, the midpoint of the top of the square.

In the lower example, the anchor point is at 0; and this sprite is drawn at 16,16 (the middle of the square). The anchor point should be something like the centre point. So for a walking character, this might be anchor point 2 (the bottom-center).

# Sound

Function 8,4 queues a sound. Queued sounds are played sequentially, each after the previous has completed, such that sounds within a channel queue will not conflict, interrupt, or overlap.

Frequency is in units of Hertz. Duration is in units of 100ths of a second. Slide is a gradual linear change in frequency, in units of Hz per 100th of a second. Sound target type 0 is the beeper. Currently, the beeper is the only available sound target.

**Queue Sound Parameters**

|         |          |           |            |             |           |            |        |
| :-----: | -------- | :-------: | :--------: | :---------: | :-------: | :--------: | :----: |
|  FF04   | FF05     |   FF06    |    FF07    |    FF08     |   FF09    |    FF0A    |  FF0B  |
| Channel | Freq Low | Freq High | Length Low | Length High | Slide Low | Slide High | Target |

# Sound Effects

Function 8,5 plays a sound effect immediately. These will be synthesised to the best ability of the available hardware. These are predefined as:

# API Functions

The following tables are a comprehensive list of all supported API functions.

For the convenience of application programmers, the application include files examples/C/neo6502.h and examples/assembly/neo6502.asm.inc define macros for these groups, their functions, and common parameters (colors, musical notes, etc).
